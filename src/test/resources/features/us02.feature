  #I had to change "Talk" to "Spreed" in the table of expected modules
  # I had to do this because the only way I was able to validate the modules was by the href value
    # all the other expected module names had their names in the link of the icons
    # all except for talk which href value washttp://qa2.trycloud.net/index.php/apps/spreed/
    #whereas if the link was formatted like the others, being consistent with their link text
    # and link value it would have been http://qa2.trycloud.net/index.php/apps/talk/
